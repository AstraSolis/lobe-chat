Sometimes one perspective isn't enough. Group Chat brings together multiple AI agents, each with their own expertise, to collaborate on your conversations. The result? Richer discussions, diverse viewpoints, and solutions you wouldn't get from any single agent.

## How It Works

An intelligent supervisor orchestrates the conversation, deciding which agents should contribute based on context and expertise. No chaos, no interruptions—just natural, flowing discussions between AI minds.

**What makes it special:**

- Multiple agents with specialized knowledge work together\*\*
- A supervisor ensures the right agent speaks at the right time
- Private messaging lets agents coordinate behind the scenes
- You get comprehensive answers from multiple perspectives

## Getting Started

### Create Your AI Team

1. **Start a group session** and invite AI agents
2. **Choose your orchestrator**—the AI that manages the conversation
3. **Set response timing**—fast-paced or thoughtful discussions
4. **Begin the conversation** and watch your AI team collaborate

### Shape the Discussion

**Public conversations** let everyone participate and build on each other's ideas.

**Private messages** let you chat directly with specific agents or let them coordinate privately.

**@mention agents** to bring specific expertise into the discussion.

## Perfect For

**Learning and research** when you need multiple perspectives on complex topics.

**Creative projects** where diverse viewpoints spark better ideas.

**Problem-solving** that benefits from different areas of expertise.

**Decision-making** when you want to explore all angles before choosing.

## Advanced Options

**Response modes:** Choose between natural, free-flowing conversations or structured, turn-based discussions.

**Custom orchestrators:** Use different AI models to manage your group dynamics.

**Tool sharing:** Let agents use tools collaboratively for complex workflows.

Group Chat transforms how you interact with AI. Instead of getting one answer, you get a conversation—complete with different viewpoints, collaborative problem-solving, and insights that emerge when AI minds work together.

*Experience AI collaboration at its finest.*
